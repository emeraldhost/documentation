## Why don't we offer TeamSpeak 6 servers yet?

For hosting providers like us to offer TeamSpeak 6 servers to customers, a special provider license from TeamSpeak is required. We have already reached out to TeamSpeak and received the following response:

::: info As of: February 2026
The TeamSpeak team is working on providing us with the appropriate license as a provider. However, a specific timeframe could not be given.
:::

As soon as we receive a license and can offer TeamSpeak 6 servers, we will announce it on our website and through our social media channels.

## Alternative: TeamSpeak 6 on a VPS

If you don't want to wait, you can install a private TeamSpeak 6 server on your own VPS. For this you need:

- A **VPS** (available for order from us: [AMD EPYC](https://emeraldhost.de/en/amd-epyc-rootserver-mieten) or [AMD Ryzen](https://emeraldhost.de/en/amd-ryzen-rootserver-mieten))
- The TeamSpeak 6 server software and [installation guide](https://github.com/teamspeak/teamspeak6-server)

::: tip Tip
This option is especially suitable if you only want to use the server for yourself and a small group.

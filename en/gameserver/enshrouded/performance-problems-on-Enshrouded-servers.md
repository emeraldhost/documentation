# Performance Problems on Enshrouded Servers

::: danger Important Notice
The Enshrouded server software is currently poorly optimized. This problem affects many hosting providers equally.
:::

## What problems can occur?

- Server lags and delays
- Choppy gameplay
- Connection drops
- Long loading times

## Why do these problems occur?

The current Enshrouded server software is unfortunately not sufficiently optimized. We already meet the recommended server requirements – however, we cannot work against poorly optimized server software.

Together with other hosting providers, we are in direct contact with the Enshrouded development team to achieve a sustainable improvement. However, we have not yet received a solution.

## What can I do?

If you are affected by performance issues, please contact us via [support ticket](https://emeraldhost.de/en/support). We can move your server to a more powerful host system **free of charge**.

::: warning Note
Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee that this will fix the issues in the long term.

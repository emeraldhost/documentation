# How to Send Chat Messages on a The Bus Server

As an admin you can send messages in the chat or send private messages to individual players.

## Send a chat message

Enter one of the following commands in the in-game chat:

```
/say <message>
```

or:

```
/send <message>
```

Both commands send a message to all players on the server.

## Send a private message

```
/whisper <playername> <message>
```

The message is only visible to the specified player.

## All commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/say <message>` | Send message to all |
| `/send <message>` | Send message to all |
| `/whisper <player> <message>` | Send private message |

:::: tip Tip
These commands require Owner or Admin permissions.

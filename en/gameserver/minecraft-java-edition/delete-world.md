# How to Delete a World on a Minecraft Java Server

::: danger Attention
If you delete the world, it cannot be restored. Create a backup beforehand in case you need the world again later.
:::

1. **Stop your Minecraft Java Edition server.**

2. **Connect to your server via [SFTP](../establish-sftp-connection.md).**

3. **Locate the `world` folder in the main folder and delete it.**

4. **Restart your server. A new world will then be generated automatically.**

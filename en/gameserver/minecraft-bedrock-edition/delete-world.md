If you delete the world, it cannot be restored. Create a backup beforehand in case you need the world again later.
:::

1. <strong>Stop your Minecraft Bedrock Edition server.</strong>

2. <strong>Open your dashboard, select your server and go to the file browser **or** connect to your server via SFTP. You can find instructions here: [Establish SFTP connection](../establish-sftp-connection.md).</strong>

3. <strong>Locate the folder ```worlds``` in the main folder.</strong>

3. <strong>Delete the folder ```Bedrock level``` there.</strong>

4. <strong>Restart your server. A new world will then be generated automatically.</strong>

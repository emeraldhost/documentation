## What is ARK Survival Evolved?

ARK Survival Evolved is an action-adventure survival game developed by Studio Wildcard. The game places you on a mysterious island called ARK, where you find yourself stranded, naked and freezing, fighting for survival.

What makes ARK special is the ability to tame, train and ride over 100 different dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures. You can gather resources, craft tools and weapons, build bases, and team up with other players or fight against them.

ARK offers both single-player and multiplayer modes and has an active community that extends the game through mods and private servers. The game is available on PC, PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo Switch.

# The Bus

## What is The Bus?

The Bus is a realistic bus simulation developed by TML Studios, set in a faithfully recreated version of Berlin. As a bus driver, you control various bus models through city traffic, stop at bus stops, pick up passengers, and follow routes according to the operating plan.

The game features a dynamic weather system with rain, snow, and fog, a realistic day-night cycle, and a detailed traffic system. Passengers behave realistically and buy tickets, while you need to follow traffic rules and react to changing road conditions.

In multiplayer mode, multiple players can drive together on a server. The dedicated server allows you to customize maps, operating plans, weather, and traffic individually. The Bus is available on Steam for PC.
